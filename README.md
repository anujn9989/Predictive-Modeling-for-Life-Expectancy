# Predictive Modeling for Life Expectancy

## Summary
This project focuses on constructing multiple linear regression models to predict life expectancy in different countries based on socio-economic factors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to understand the influence of societal features such as GDP per capita and happiness score on life expectancy. The developed predictive model holds potential utility in aiding individuals to estimate their own life expectancy based on personal happiness and wealth metrics.

## Key Findings
* Predictive Model Coefficients: 
The model coefficients indicate that GDP per capita has a greater impact on life expectancy than the happiness score. For instance, a one-unit increase in GDP per capita is associated with a larger increase in life expectancy compared to a one-unit increase in the happiness score.

*  Sample Predictions: 
Using the predictive model, we can estimate the life expectancy of individuals under different scenarios, providing valuable insights into the potential impact of socio-economic factors on longevity.

## Tools and Packages
The predictive models were implemented using Python, utilizing libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The provided code includes data preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation steps for two distinct predictive models.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of the predictive models was performed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared scores. The first predictive model achieved a relatively low RMSE and a high R-squared score, indicating accurate predictions. However, the second model exhibited higher error metrics, suggesting lower accuracy in predicting life expectancy.

## Conclusion
The analysis underscores the significance of socio-economic factors such as GDP per capita and happiness score in determining life expectancy. The first predictive model, which considers these factors, proves to be more accurate in predicting life expectancy compared to alternative models. Overall, the project sheds light on the complex interplay between societal features and public health outcomes.
